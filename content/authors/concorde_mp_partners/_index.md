[Concorde MB Partners](www.cmbp.hu) is an independent, Hungarian-owned firm in the field of corporate transactions with several decades of experience, operating in line with international best practices. Concorde MB Partners is part of [IMAP](www.imap.com), the leading global mid-market M&A advisory organization. The firm offers company valuation, company sales, and company acquisition. It maintains a long-term relationship with all private equity and venture capital investors and strategic buyers, understands their thinking, and can help in capital raising, other corporate finance advisory services, and even manages stock exchange transactions. 

One of our core strengths is helping family enterprises and private businesses where there is no succession within the family, or they want to strengthen their company by selling it to a professional partner. This is very often the case with organically grown late-stage startups or scale-ups, who have proven their market success but found a limitation to their growth. 

Data is a key ingredient in valuations and corporate finance services, and it is also a key asset for almost any companies that we buy, sell, or help in their market research, business research, and Ecotech companies, for their research and innovation activities.

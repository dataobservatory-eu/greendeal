Julia has a biologist and science communication background. After completing her university studies, she embarked on a career in film production, working on a variety of high-end television and tentpole projects. Julia's experience working in film production also led her to recognize a gap in sustainable practices within the industry. That's why she was motivated to co-found Green Eyes Production, a consultancy that specializes in implementing sustainable solutions within the film, television, and media sectors. By combining her scientific background with her passion for the creative industry, Julia aims to lead the charge in promoting environmentally responsible practices throughout the world of entertainment production.

# Big Data Creates Inequalities

Only the largest corporations, best-endowed universities, and rich governments can afford data collection and processing capacities that are large enough to harness the advantages of AI.

## Big data that works for all

- <p style="font-size:75%">No matter how big is the problem or how small is your team, `Reprex` fill your reports, dashboards, newsletters, books with data and its visualization.
- <p style="font-size:75%">Learn R with us: you can reduce the inequalities by joining the open source movement, learning to run open source software, ask for help, improve the tutorials, the documentation, and eventually learn to make the computer work for you.
- <p style="font-size:75%">Contributor Covenant: Participating in open source is often a highly collaborative experience. We‚Äôre encouraged to create in public view, and we‚Äôre incentivized to welcome contributions of all kinds from people around the world. This makes the practice of open source as much social as it is technical.</p>

## R is a functional language

- R is both a statistical environment and a programming language
- R, the open source and further developed version of the S language, is mainly functional
- If you did a task at least twice, the 3rd time you better write a function script to keep doing it forever.
- Most of your effort will be to find a well-written function for your work
- If you cannot find a function, you will modify somebody else's function, or eventually write your own

## R + YAML + markdown = web ready

---

- [Learn YAML in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/): tell the computer what you want to do with a document
- [R Markdown basics](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html): it is just a plain markdown that allows you to insert little R program 'chunks'.
- [Awesome markdown editors and pre-writers](https://github.com/mundimark/awesome-markdown-editors): find a convenient tool
- [Google Docs to markdown](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607): practice by translating your Google Docs text to markdown. It is *very* easy.

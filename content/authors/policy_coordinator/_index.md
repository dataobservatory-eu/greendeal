This is a sample profile for a volunteer policy coordinator, who helps us get in touch with potential users of our free, open, climate change related data, maps, and find out how it could be put into use in policy making on local, regional, national or international level; or be used in evidence-based policy research in a university or consultancy or NGO setting.

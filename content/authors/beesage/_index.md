[BeeSage](https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/post/2022-10-31_beesage/) is a modular [beehive monitoring system](https://beesage.co/) that boosts productivity and honey yield to benefit the Earth through data-driven pollination. Our software and hardware such as Smart Beehive Scales help beekeepers mitigate risks and enable informed decisions, while turning every apiary into a weather station.

BeeSage is also creating the **HiveMap** as a data analytics product that enables beekeepers associations, environmental organisations and other stakeholders to turn beehive and remote sensing data into valuable insights.
